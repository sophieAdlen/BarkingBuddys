## BarkingBuddys
This project is a dog care recommendation service built with React + Vite.

## React + Vite Setup
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## What Does the Service Do?
BarkingBuddys is a recommendation engine designed for dog owners. It provides:

** Food recommendations based on the dog's breed, age, weight, and allergies.

** Activity suggestions tailored to the dog’s energy levels and interests.

** Dog care advice on grooming, health checks, and vaccinations.

** Social platform suggestions to connect with local groups.

**Product recommendations like toys, beds, and other dog accessories.

## Who Is the Target Audience?
This service is aimed at dog owners who want personalized advice on how to take care of their pets. It’s especially helpful for those looking to optimize their dog’s diet, activities, and general well-being.

## Ethical and Safety Considerations
The service uses AI to generate recommendations based on user inputs, but it’s important to consult a veterinarian for personalized medical advice.
All personal data is anonymized, and no sensitive information about the dog owner is collected.

## Development Considerations
We made a trade-off between simplicity and functionality to keep the service accessible while ensuring it delivers useful recommendations.
The design was chosen to be user-friendly, with a focus on quick and easy interaction for all dog owners.
